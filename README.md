# 2048

## Description
This is a JavaScript implementation of the classic 2048 game for Sprig! The objective is to combine tiles with the same value to reach the 2048 tile (same rules as 2048 - follows convention)! 

## How to Play
- Use the **W**, **A**, **S**, and **D** keys to move the tiles up, left, down, and right, respectively.
- When two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values.
- The game is won when a tile with the value 2048 is created.
- The game is lost when there are no empty spaces and no possible merges left.

## Features
